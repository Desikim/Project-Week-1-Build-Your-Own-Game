## ðŸŽ®Project DescriptionðŸŽ®
I'm currently learning to code with Python. This project serves the purpose to gain more practical experience.
## Project Description
Write a short description of your project. Write 1-2 sentences about the game you chose to build and why.

## ðŸ‘¾Game RulesðŸ‘¾
No cheating!
## Rules
Briefly describe the rules of the game.

## ðŸ’¡WorkflowðŸ’¡
A rough outline of my workflow of this project:
## Workflow
Outline the workflow you used in your project. What are the steps you went through?

1. Choose a game and think about the logic behind the function of it
2. Write down the logic/single steps needed that come to mind in #softcode 
3. Set up the base data of the game and create functions
4. Test, debugg and imrpove code permanently by adding #comments 
5. Implementing changes according to the #comments
## Organization
How did you organize your work? Did you use any tools like a kanban board?

## ðŸ”®OrganizationðŸ”®
Happened mainly in my head...
- #Comments and softcode for rough outline
- GitHub project board for task overview
- Documenting problems and ideas for improvements
What does your repository look like? Explain your folder and file structure.
