## ðŸŽ®Project DescriptionðŸŽ®
I'm currently learning to code with Python. This project serves the purpose to gain more practical experience.

## ðŸ‘¾Game RulesðŸ‘¾
No cheating!

## ðŸ’¡WorkflowðŸ’¡
A rough outline of my workflow of this project:

1. Choose a game and think about the logic behind the function of it
2. Write down the logic/single steps needed that come to mind in #softcode 
3. Set up the base data of the game and create functions
4. Test, debugg and imrpove code permanently by adding #comments 
5. Implementing changes according to the #comments

## ðŸ”®OrganizationðŸ”®
Happened mainly in my head...
- #Comments and softcode for rough outline
- GitHub project board for task overview
- Documenting problems and ideas for improvements
