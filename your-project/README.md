## ðŸ’ƒProject DescriptionðŸ’ƒ
I'm currently learning to code with Python. This project serves the purpose to gain experience 

## ðŸ‘¾Game RulesðŸ‘¾
No cheating!

## ðŸ’¡WorkflowðŸ’¡
Steps I took to create this game:
1. Choose a game and think about the logic behind the function of it
2. Write down the logic/single steps in softcode 
3. Start coding and test, test, test!

## ðŸ“‹OrganizationðŸ“‹
Happened mainly in my head...but with the help of this readme file and using softcode and #comments 
My repository is set up...
